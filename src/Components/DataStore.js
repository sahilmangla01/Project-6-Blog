The Nizamate of Hyderabad, sympathetic to the Raj, warns Scott's office of the impending danger. Undeterred, Catherine enlists A. Rama Raju, an ambitious officer in the Indian Imperial Police, to quell the threat. Seeking clues to Malli's whereabouts, Raju and his uncle, Venkateswarulu, attend several pro-independence gatherings where he feigns to support independence. Lachhu, Bheem's gullible aide, believing Raju's ruse, attempts to recruit him into Bheem's plot. Before taking Raju to Bheem, Lachhu discovers Raju's identity as a police officer and flees. "

      ,long_description:"It is then that Omar Zafar proposes to pay a hefty amount to the one who steals the ancient historically significant Kohinoor Diamond from London's high security tower. It is then that Rajveer Nanda (played by Hrithik Roshan) executes a perfectly planned diamond heist with Hamid Gul's (played by Javed Jaffrey) confederation without a single flaw or any hard evidence. Rajveer contravenes to accept the reward in exchange of the Kohinoor diamond as he develops suspicion. He also comes across Harleen Sahni (played by Katrina Kaif) who is a receptionist working in the Bank of Shimla. She is on her pursuit to find her perfect match with the help of online dating portal. She has been living her small yet happy life in India post her parents' demise after which she was brought back by her grandmother to take care of her. She is a smart yet whimsical girl waiting for her perfect match. On the day of the date, Harleen misconceives Rajveer to be Vicky and approaches Rajveer which leaves him astonished by her grace and he reverts back to her cute salutation. Harleen blindly falls for Rajveer and gets carried away by his charm"

His friend Smiley runs a liquor shop and supports him in every one of his endeavors. His father, Jagjeet Singh runs a shop dealing in funeral items and is sunk deep into loans he owes to various banks. Due to low turnover, he is unable to pay back the EMI's.",

Virat is forced by his parents and younger sisters to meet Saiba (Sonakshi Sinha), who they choose for him to get married to. During that interaction, Virat realizes that Saiba is an old-fashioned girl. Wherein, actually Saiba was pretending forced by her parents to abide to the ceremony rituals. Saiba is a college-level boxer and a modern girl. Virat realises this and falls in love with her but Saiba does not abide. But eventually, they both fall in love with each other. Once Virat and his sub-inspector of police and mate Mukund (SUMEET RAGHAVAN) witnesses a bus explosion which they had travelled by. In no time, Virat captures the culprit who blew the bus into flames and discovers that the culprit is just an executer who is a sleeper cell who is hired to plant the bomb. To further investigations, Virat finds out that the actual terrorist mastermind behind this explosion is planning in the city a fleet of explosions in the days to come.",

Of course, Dutt's not the way so the man is quickly shown the door. Right then and there, Rajkumar Hirani establishes the fact that Sanju isn't your regular biopic! Sanjay Dutt may be synonymous with Gandhigiri but in real life, the picture was quite different. Bole toh in Sanju's words, Apna Life Full Saanp Seedhe Ka Board Hai, Kabhie Up To Kabhie Down!",

      long_description:"1. Panchayat : Season 2 of Panchayat takes us back to Phulera, as Panchayat Secretary Abhishek Tripathi continues to struggle between feeling at home and wanting more for himself. 2. Delhi Crime :  Released in 2022, Season 2, detailing a series of gruesome home invasions, is no different. In five fast-paced episodes, we go back into the world of Delhi crime and Delhi police, made very real by the standout cast, led by Shefali Shah.3. Rocket Boys : Based on the lives of Dr. Homi J. Bhabha and Dr. Vikram Sarabhai,Rocket Boys is a fascinating peek into India's formative years in the field of aeronautics. Jim Sarbh and Ishwak Singh's easy camaraderie translates well on screen and doesn't let the show drag. 4. Human : If you've ever wondered how unethical and dangerous the business of saving lives can be, Human, a show about the dark side of Indian pharma, has the answer for you. The gripping psychological thriller will compel you to binge-watch the full season, especially with Shefali Shah's portrayal of a ruthless pharma boss.5. Apharan : Much like the first season, the second season of Apharan fully embraces its over-the-top, weird world and doesn't give the very aptly cast Arunoday Singh time to breathe. There's suspense, action, that kitschy '70s vibe, and so much more that keeps fans hooked through the 11-episode run.6. Gullak : In its third season, Gullak continued to charm fans with its disarming portrayal of the middle-class Mishra family and their problems, so relatable that for many it's almost like watching their own parents and siblings on screen. In five crisp episodes, Jameel Khan, Geetanjali Kulkarni, Vaibhav Raj Gupta, and Harsh Mayar prove yet again that ordinary is not always boring.7. NCR Days : Not your average college show, NCR Days is the story of Monu, played by Nikhil Vijay, who comes to NCR from Jodhpur for an MBA, primarily so he can marry his girlfriend back home. In his journey of growing, changing, and finding himself, he makes new friends and learns some hard lessons. Writer-director Ambrish Verma doesn't just create a rich, complex world in only five episodes, but also plays a central character in the show.8. Abhay : Season 3 of Abhay continues to follow UP Police SP Abhay Pratap Singh (played by Kunal Kemmu) as he battles personal demons and solves gruesome crimes. This season differs from earlier seasons in that it pits him against one central villain — a charismatic cult leader planning mass murder, played to perfection by Vijay Raaz. Kunal's performance keeps you rooting for Abhay through some very tumultuous times.9. Campus Diaries : Featuring some very popular content creators, like Harsh Beniwal and Saloni Gaur, Campus Diaries tells the coming-of-age stories of six students at Excel University. They navigate love, life, and all the angst and challenges that come with learning how to be an adult in the real world.10. College Romance : A quintessential new-adult rom-com, College Romance continued to be a hit with fans as Season 3 released in 2022. In just five easy-to-binge episodes, love and friendship are tested amidst scandals and long-distance relationships. So, if you're not in college anymore, get ready to miss the good ol' days!"

Here's how internet reacted to his remark.Elon Musk has mocked the box office hit Barbie on Twitter, now called X. The Tesla founder had recently accused the film of using the term 'patriarchy' at the drop of a hat. He was responding to a Barbenheimer meme that compared Twitter to Barbie and his new X name for his social network to Oppenheimer.Elon Musk recently said, “If you take a shot every time Barbie says the word ‘patriarchy,’ you will pass out before the movie ends.” Barbie follows ‘stereotypical Barbie’ (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) as they leave Barbieland and venture into the real world following an existential crisis.",

Despite its magical, fictional setting, Avatar is not devoid of socio-political themes. It addresses race, civilisation, takes a strong anti-military stand and makes a plea for environment conservation through its simple story of parents and children. A spectacular climax revolves around parents protecting their children and vice versa.",

This exercise will also help enhance your twisting stability.To perform this move, go down on your fours. Make sure your hands are directly under your shoulders with your back and legs aligned in a straight line. Contract your abs and rotate and pivot towards the right. Press your hands while knocking your feet on the other side. Repeat this with the other leg as well.“Reverse lunges are an excellent way to work your hamstrings, glutes, calves and quads, while providing you with lower body strength,” said Singh. It is a great option for beginners as it is easy to control the backward motion.First, stand shoulder-width apart. Then, inhale and carefully take a big step backwards with your right foot as you bend both knees to 90 degrees, making sure your weight is distributed evenly between both legs. Now, exhale and extend both knees while transferring your weight onto your left foot. At the same time, raise your right foot to bring your knee near your chest.

And when your body’s tissues — from your muscles and bones to heart and lungs — recover, they become slightly fitter than they were before. That way, the next time you perform the same workout, you won’t suffer as much damage."

About 5 percent of American adults stick to this way of eating, and that number is on the rise, with about 23 percent of adults reporting that they’ve eaten less meat over the past 12 months. That’s probably because most experts and health organizations agree that eating more plants is a good thing, no matter how strict a vegetarian diet you follow.right up arrow Interestingly, vegetarians are inclined to live healthy lifestyles even outside of meal time. In general, they exercise more frequently and tend to live longer than nonvegetarians."

It improves circulation, lowers blood pressure and cholesterol, manages weight, and reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. All of these factors lower the risk of heart disease. Additional benefits of aerobic activity include increased stamina, a stronger immune system, improved mood, and keeping you active and independent as you age. For optimal heart health, get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week."
